# predator-ng
A GUI client to interact with my (private for now) fork of the 3rd party linux [kernel module](https://github.com/JafarAkhondali/acer-predator-turbo-and-rgb-keyboard-linux-module) for Acer Predator and Nitro notebooks

The client mainly supports controlling the keyboard RGB for now, but there's plans for fan control as well (maybe. depends on how busy I am and how complicated this gets)

## Disclaimer
This client is primarily made for use with my PT314-52s and custom changes of the kernel module and is not guaranteed to work with other models. Use at your own risk.
